                Asuka Akagawa is a Japanese interdisciplinary artist, composer, and guitarist pursuing sophistication primarily in auditory expression. In achieving this, he follows three general steps; 
                first he questions as many whys and hows of everything surrounding him as possible, second gathers the necessary information on the subject through meticulous analysis and examination, 
                and third he outputs his interpretation and response after methodical training on the expressive means. 
                <br><p></p>
                When Akagawa picked up the guitar at age 15, he soon became addicted to the complex structure of the instrument as he was raised in a family of mathematicians (architect, software engineer, etc.).
                Unlike the Koto (a traditional Japanese stringed instrument) or the piano, both which he briefly studied at an early age, the guitar had five positions to play the same pitch. This nature of the 
                instrument allowed Akagawa to approach guitar the same way he would solve a puzzle. 
                <br><p></p>
                Consequently, he immediately began studying music theory and immersed in its utilizations in composition and improvisation. As he found equal interest in all genres of music including jazz, classical, 
                country, funk, fusion, rock, progressive metal, etc., he did not establish himself as a guitarist specializing in a style. Instead, he favored to blend various elements of different styles and sought 
                to develop a unique and personal style.
                <br><p></p>
                He also enjoys visiting museums as much as he loved listening to live music, thus after a few years of profound contemplation on music, Akagawa began exploring the potentiality in the interdisciplinary 
                arts field initiating with visual expression. Simultaneously, exploiting his inherited aptitude for mathematical thinking, he began experimenting with the utilization of digital signal processing and 
                programming to expand his palette of expression.  
                <br><p></p>
                Akagawa’s influences include virtuosos from a wide range of fields. First and foremost are his mentors at Berklee including Mick Goodrick, Jon Damian, and Greg Hopkins to name a few. Mick Goodrick, 
                whom Akagawa spent the longest time studying with enlightened him the significance of pursuing perfection in intended expression, in other words the knowledge and skill on the instrument, and emotion, 
                the one essential element that must not be neglected in any artistic performance. Other influences include composers such as Claude Debussy, Béla Bartók, Arnold Schönberg, painters such as Claude Monet, 
                Edvard Munch, Jackson Pollock, filmmakers such as Martin Scorsese, architects such as Renzo Piano, Ando Tadao, physicists such as Albert Einstein, and entrepreneurs such as Steve Jobs.
